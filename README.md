# open-system-monitor
an open-sourced system monitor for in-case displays.

If you've ever seen PC builds with a display inside the case, you've probably wondered what's out there to utilize such things. most people have it connected directly to the GPU and have a launch script to open something like ADIA64. Others use Mobro on the system with a Rasberry PI or similar to drive Mobro's web display over the LAN network. The problem is, that both these solutions are Windows only and are either paid or have some features behind a paywall.

That's where this comes in, fully open under GPLv3 and easily customizable via Python and any front-end libraries that work with Flask, as well as the fact that it can work on Linux systems as well.

I'd recommend looking at the Wiki of his repo for more info on how to set it up and utilize it.
